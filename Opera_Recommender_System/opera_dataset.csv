L'Orfeo,"In the fields of Thrace the marriage of Orpheus and Eurydice (Euridice) is being celebrated. Orpheus sings a song of love and praise. The nymphs and shepherds share in his joy as they accompany him to the temple.
Orpheus sings to the woods, but his mood of celebration is ended by the arrival of Sylvia, who tells him of Eurydice's death from a snake bite. He is overcome with grief, but resolves to bring Eurydice back from Hades.
Orpheus is led by Hope (Speranza) to the gates of Hell, where she leaves him.
At the River Styx he sings to the boatman Charon (""Possente spirto, e formidabil nume"" - Powerful spirit, formidable god), who pities him but does not let him cross. After more singing from Orpheus, Charon falls into a deep sleep. Orpheus takes the oars and crosses the river.
In Hades, Proserpine (Proserpina), who has heard Orpheus's music, begs her husband Pluto to allow him to return to earth with Eurydice. Pluto agrees on condition that Orpheus leads her out of the underworld without once looking back. On their journey home, Orpheus begins to doubt that Eurydice is behind him and, hearing a sound, he turns back and Eurydice vanishes before his eyes. Orpheus continues alone, accompanied by the lamentations of the chorus.
In the fields of Thrace, Orpheus pours forth his grief, but is answered only by Echo. He vows to renounce women. His father, Apollo, descends from the skies in order to console him. Together they ascend to the heavens, where Orpheus will once again see Eurydice in the sun and the stars.
",Claudio Monteverdi,Baroque
Orfeo ed Euridice,"Orpheus stands before Eurydice's tomb, lost in grief. Coming to his senses, he resolves to rescue his love from Hades. Amor (Love) comforts him, telling him that with love anything can be overcome. However, she imposes conditions. When leading Eurydice from Hell, he must let go of her hand and not look upon her until they have reached the earth's surface again.
Orpheus approaches Hades, where the Furies sing of Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog of Hell. The beauty of his singing finally elicits their compassion and they allow him safe passage. He arrives in Elysium (during which, in the 1774 version, is heard the famous ""Dance of the Blessed Spirits"") and sings of the beauty that surrounds him, but also of its emptiness, as he cannot find Eurydice. She is brought to him blindfolded and they prepare
to leave.
On a path leading out of Hades, Eurydice reproaches Orpheus for what she takes to be his coldness and suggests that death would have been preferable. Unable to bear her laments, Orpheus turns to look at her, and Eurydice dies. Orpheus is prevented from killing himself by Love, who, bringing Eurydice back to life, reunites the lovers. The opera ends with a chorus in praise of Love.",Christoph Willibald Gluck,Classical
Orphée aux Enfers,"A melodrama (Introduction and Melodrame) opens the work. Public Opinion explains who she is - the guardian of morality (""Qui suis-je? du Théâtre Antique""). She seeks to rework the story of Orphée (Orpheus) and Eurydice - who, despite being husband and wife, hate each other - into a moral tale for the ages. However, she has her work cut out for her: Eurydice is in love with the shepherd, Aristée (Aristaeus), who lives next door (""La femme dont le coeur rêve""), and Orphée is in love with Chloë, a shepherdess. When Orphée mistakes Eurydice for her, everything comes out, and Eurydice insists they break the marriage off. However Orphée, fearing Public Opinion's reaction, torments her into keeping the scandal quiet using violin music, which she hates.
We now meet Aristée - who is, in fact, Pluton (Pluto) - keeping up his disguise by singing a pastoral song about those awful sheep (""Moi, je suis Aristée""). Since Pluton was originally played by a famous female impersonator, this song contains numerous falsetto notes. Eurydice, however, has discovered what she thinks is a plot by Orphée to kill Aristée, but is in fact a conspiracy between him and Pluton to kill her, so Pluton may have her. Pluton tricks her into walking into the trap by showing immunity to it, and, as she dies, transforms into his true form (Transformation Scene) Eurydice finds that death is not so bad when the God of Death is in love with you (""La mort m'apparaît souriante""), and so keeps coming back for one more verse. They descend into the Underworld as soon as Eurydice has left a note telling her husband she has been unavoidably detained (Descent to the Underworld).
All seems to be going well for Orphée until Public Opinion catches up with him, and threatens to ruin his violin teaching career unless he goes to rescue his wife. Orphée reluctantly agrees.
The scene changes to Olympus, where the Gods sleep out of boredom (""Dormons, dormons""). Things look a bit more interesting for them when Diane (Diana) returns and begins gossiping about Actaeon, her current love (""Quand Diane descend dans la plaine""). However, Jupiter, shocked at the behaviour of the supposedly virgin goddess, has turned Actaeon into a stag. Pluton then arrives, and reveals to the other gods the pleasures of Hell, leading them to revolt against horrid ambrosia, hideous nectar, and the sheer boredom of Olympus (""Aux armes, dieux et demi-dieux!""). Jupiter's demands to know what is going on lead them to point out his hypocrisy at great length, describing - and poking fun of - all his mythological affairs. However, little further progress can be made before news of Orphée's arrival forces the gods to get onto their best behaviour. Pluton is worried he will be forced to give Eurydice back, and, after a quotation from Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice sends the gods to tears, Jupiter announces that he is going to Hell to sort everything out. The other gods beg to come with him, he consents, and mass celebration breaks out at this holiday (""Gloire! gloire à Jupiter"").
Eurydice is being kept locked up by Pluto, and is finding life very dull. Her gaoler, a dull-witted tippler by the name of John Styx, is not helping, particularly his habit of telling, at the slightest provocation, all about how he was King of the Beotians until he died. But if he had not died, he would still be king (""Quand j'étais roi de Béotie"").
Jupiter spots where Pluton hid Eurydice whilst being shown around by him, and slips through the keyhole by turning into a beautiful, golden fly. He meets Eurydice on the other side, and sings a love duet with her where his part consists entirely of buzzing (""Bel insecte à l'aile dorée""). Afterwards, he reveals himself to her, and promises to help her, largely because he wants her for himself.
The scene shifts to a huge party the gods are having in Hell, where ambrosia, nectar, and propriety are nowhere to be seen (""Vive le vin! Vive Pluton!""). Eurydice sneaks in disguised as a bacchante (""J'ai vu le dieu Bacchus""), but Jupiter's plan to sneak her out is interrupted by calls for a dance. Unfortunately, Jupiter can only dance minuets which everyone else finds boring and awful (""La la la. Le menuet n'est vraiment si charmant""). Things liven up, though, as the most famous number in the operetta, the Galop Infernal (best known as the music of the Can-can) starts, and everyone throws himself into it with wild abandon (""Ce bal est original"").
Ominous violin music heralds the approach of Orphée (Entrance of Orphée and Public Opinion), but Jupiter has a plan, and promises to keep Eurydice away from him. As with the standard myth, Orphée must not look back, or he'll lose Eurydice forever (""Ne regarde pas en arrière!""). Public Opinion keeps a close eye on him, to keep him from cheating, but Jupiter throws a lightning bolt, making him jump and look back, and so all ends happily, with a reprise of the Galop.

Ormindo,"The Maghreb princes, Amida and Ormindo, who are assisting in the defense of Mauretania, are both in love with Erisbe who is unhappily married to Hariadeno, Fessa's elderly king. The princes agree to remain friends while they test her love. During the course of the opera, there is much plotting by Amore, Princess Sicle (Amida's abandoned lover) and Erice (Sicle's nurse) to interfere with the contest. Erice stages a séance to communicate with the 'dead' Sicle who reproaches Amida for his inconstancy which had driven her to suicide. Amida, overcome with remorse, realizes that he still loves Princess Sicle and is overjoyed when it is revealed that she is actually alive and not a ghost. Meanwhile, Erisbe and Ormindo decide to elope to Tunis, where Ormindo must defend his homeland from attack. When King Hariadeno discovers their adultery, he orders his captain, Osmano, to have them poisoned. However, Osmano substitutes a sleeping potion for the poison at the urging of Mirinda (Erisbe's confidante) who has promised to marry him if he spares the lovers. All ends more or less happily when the King learns that Ormindo is actually his son from a youthful liaison. He forgives everyone and cedes his kingdom to Ormindo.",Francesco Cavalli,Baroque
Giasone,"Hercules (Ercole) has persuaded Jason (Giasone) to abandon his betrothed, Hypsipyle (Isifile), and continue his quest for the Golden Fleece. Jason finds himself on Colchis, where he becomes the lover of the queen Medea, without realizing her identity. Medea returns Jason's love and rejects her betrothed Aegeus (Egeo).
Orestes (Oreste), a friend of Hypsipyle, tries unsuccessfully to cross-examine Demo, the stuttering servant of Aegeus.

Hypsipyle waits for news of Jason. On learning of Jason's love for Medea, she resolves to go to Colchis.
Meanwhile, Jason captures the Golden Fleece, after killing the monsters who guard it.
On the journey home the gods wreck Jason's and Medea's ship and bring them to Hypsipyle's island home in order to ensure Jason's marriage to her. When she appears, Jason denies all knowledge of her and claims she is mad.
Jason is persuaded to kill Hypsipyle by the jealous Medea, and orders Besso, one of his guards, to carry out the murder. But the plan goes wrong and Besso throws Medea into the sea instead of Hypsipyle.
She is saved by Aegeus and is forced to acknowledge his fidelity as he swears revenge on Jason. As Jason sleeps, Aegeus attempts to kill him, but is stopped by Hypsipyle.
Seeing Hypsipyle alive, Jason is told by Besso of the death of Medea. Medea appears, accompanied by Aegeus, and encourages Jason to return to Hypsipyle, but he refuses. However, Hypsipyle's lament (""Infelice, che ascolto"") wins him back and the opera ends in joyful reconciliation.

Medea,"The sorceress Medea (Médée) and her husband Jason are in Corinth, under siege from the Thessaliens for plotting against their king. Creon (Créon), king of Corinth, has allied himself with Orontes (Oronte), prince of Argos, by promising him that he can marry Creon's daughter Creusa (Créuse). Medea rightly suspects Jason of loving Creusa.
Medea is asked to leave Corinth by Creon, since his people fear her presence. Creon proceeds to encourage the love between Jason and his daughter.
Medea warns Orontes about Jason and Creusa, who, it emerges,are to marry with Creon's blessing. Medea infuses with poison the robe she has promised to give to Creusa.
Creusa enters wearing the robe but the poison has not yet taken effect. Medea tells Crontes that the marriage between Jason and Creusa will not take place. She warns Creon that unless his daughter marries Orontes, she will never leave Corinth. Creon attempts to arrest her, but Medea turns his guards against each other and invokes her magic powers to drive the king mad.
Creusa begs Medea to restore her father's sanity. Medea agrees, but the news arrives that Creon has killed Orontes and then himself. Creusa seeks vengeance, but Medea makes the poison in her robe begin to work. Upon finding the princess dying, Jason swears revenge, but is mocked by Medea who tells him that she has killed their children. The opera ends with Medea's destruction of the palace.",Marc-Antoine Charpentier,Baroque
Calisto,"Jove (Giove) and Mercury (Mercurio) are visiting Arcadia. Jove sees the nymph Callisto, a follower of Diana, the virgin goddess of the hunt, and attempts to seduce her. She resists his advances, but finally succumbs when he disguises himself as Diana.
Meanwhile the real Diana, because of her vow of chastity, cannot return the love of the beautiful shepherd boy Endymion (Endimione). Diana is supported by one of her nymphs, the elderly Lymphea (Linfea), who secretly yearns for a husband, but spurns the advances of a young satyr.
On Mount Lycaeus Endymion sings to the moon, the symbol of Diana. As he sleeps, Diana covers him with kisses. He awakes and they sing of their love.

Les Troyens,"
The site of the abandoned Greek camp on the plains of Troy
The Trojans are rejoicing that the Greeks have departed after 10 years of war and they prepare to drag into the city the great wooden horse which the Greeks have left behind.
Cassandre alone, daughter of King Priam, gifted with prophecy, fears the fall of Troy. She knows that her marriage to Chorèbe is doomed, and grieves that he thinks she has lost her mind since, along with the gift of prophecy, she carries the curse of never being believed. Chorèbe urges her to join the rejoicing, while she begs him to leave her and the doomed city before it is too late, but he refuses.
The royal family of Troy joins the people in thanking the gods for their deliverance. They are interrupted by Énée with strange tidings of the fate of the priest Laocon who, fearing Greeks bearing gifts, had been trying to urge the people to destroy the wooden horse when two serpents had emerged from the sea and devoured him.
Fearing the wrath of the gods who, it is concluded, must have punished Laocon for sacrilege, Priam orders the horse to be taken into Troy at once and the people prepare to make offerings to appease the gods. Cassandre watches, helpless, crying out that the city is doomed. 
The ghost of Hector warns Énée to flee the city and take the gods of Troy to Italy, where he is destined to found a great nation. The priest Panthée runs in wounded, carrying the sacred images, with the news that the Greeks have burst out of the horse and are destroying the city. King Priam is dead. They prepare to fight, joined by Ascagne, the young son of Énée, and Chorèbe.
Cassandre tells the praying Trojan women that Énée will escape and found a new Troy in Italy. Chorèbe is dead and she prepares to kill herself and exhorts the women to join her. As the Greeks burst in Cassandre and the women kill themselves. 
Surrounded by her people Didon celebrates the seventh anniversary of the founding of Carthage - after her husband had been killed she and her people had been forced to flee from their home in Tyre. Her sister Anna tries to encourage her to think of loving again; but she calls down a curse on herself if she is ever false to the memory of her husband, symbolised for her by his ring which she wears.
The poet Iopas announces the arrival of storm-tossed travellers seeking refuge, which she grants in memory of her own trials. nÈe is disguised as a sailor and it is Ascagne who asks for asylum, offering the riches of Troy in return. Panthée tells Didon their leader is Énée, whose destiny it is to find a glorious death in Italy, and she welcomes the Trojans.
Didon's minister Narbal brings news that Iarbas, fierce king of the Numidians, whose suit had been refused by Dido, is attacking Carthage, which is not strong enough to withstand him. Énée throws off his disguise and offers assistance. He leaves Ascagne in Didon's protection as he prepares to lead the Carthaginians into battle.
Narbal is worried that now that the Numidians have been defeated, Didon no longer attends to affairs of state, but spends the time hunting and feasting. When Anna explains that Didon loves Énée, he is concerned, knowing that fate calls Énée to Italy. But Anna sees no problem, feeling that Énée is equally bound to Carthage. She is delighted by her sister's happiness.
Didon, Énée and other Trojans appear and are entertained by songs and ballets, but Didon dismisses them and asks Iopas for something simpler. He sings a hymn to the goddess Ceres, but even that Didon finds not to her taste.
She asks Énée to tell her of the fate of Andromache, widow of Hector and is horrified to learn that Andromache has married her captor Pyrrhus, who had killed Priam and whose father Achilles had killed her husband Hector; but Didon also feels in some way absolved for her own love for Énée.
Unheeded by her, Ascagne playfully removes her former husband's ring from her finger. All leave except Didon and Énée, who confess and consummate their love. As they leave the moonlit garden the god Mercury appears, strikes the shield of Énée and shouts ""Italy!""
Hylas, a young Trojan sailor, sings of his lost homeland as he falls asleep.
Panthée and other Trojan leaders prepare to leave: the ghosts of Hector and other dead Trojans have been seen along with other portents warning them they must be on their way. They expect that Énée will be strong minded and leave Didon. Two Trojan sentries have no desire to leave, having found girls and comfort in Carthage. Énée has told Didon he must go. Though grieved by her suffering, he remains firm in his resolve and prepares to bid her a last farewell, his resolve being strengthened by the appearance of the Trojan ghosts urging him on to Italy. When he tries to answer Didon's reproaches with explanations about his duty, she curses him and his gods.
Didon begs Anna to plead with Énée. Anna feels guilt at having encouraged Didon to love Énée, but assures her that he loves her. They learn that the Trojans have already sailed.
The distraught Didon announces her intention of sacrificing Énée's gifts as an offering to the gods of the dead, intending to kill herself at the same time.
The pyre has been built and the offerings placed on it. When the fire is lit, Didon mounts the pyre and stabs herself.
A vision of the glory of Rome appears, invisible to the bystanders, and Didon dies, prophesying that Hannibal will avenge the wrongs of Carthage on the Romans. The Carthaginians curse the race of Énée.

Castor et Pollux,"Background note: Castor and Pollux are famous heroes. Despite being twin brothers, one of them (Pollux) is immortal and the other (Castor) is mortal. They are both in love with the princess Telaira (Télaïre), but she loves only Castor. The twins have fought a war against an enemy king, Lynceus (Lyncée) which has resulted in disaster: Castor has been slain. The opera opens with his funeral rites. Telaira expresses her grief to her friend Phoebe (Phébé) in Tristes apprêts, one of Rameau's most famous arias. Pollux and his band of Spartan warriors interrupt the mourning bringing the dead body of Lynceus who has been killed in revenge. Pollux confesses his love for Telaira. She avoids giving a reply, instead asking him to go and plead with his father Jupiter, king of the gods, to restore Castor to life.
Pollux expresses his conflicting emotions in the aria Nature, amour, qui partagez mon coeur. If he does what Telaira says and manages to persuade Jupiter to restore his brother to life, he knows he will lose the chance to marry her. But he finally yields to her pleas. Jupiter descends from above and Pollux begs him to bring Castor back to life. Jupiter replies he is powerless to alter the laws of fate. The only way to save Castor is for Pollux to take his place among the dead. Pollux, despairing that he will never win Telaira, decides to go to the Underworld. Jupiter tries to dissuade him with a ballet of the Celestial Pleasures led by Hebe, goddess of youth, but Pollux is resolute.
The stage shows the entrance to the Underworld, guarded by monsters and demons. Phoebe gathers the Spartans to prevent Pollux from entering the gate of the Underworld. Pollux refuses to be dissuaded, even though Phoebe declares her love for him. When Telaira arrives and she sees Pollux's true love for her, Phoebe realises her love will be unrequited. She urges the demons of the Underworld to stop him entering (Sortez, sortez d'esclavage/Combattez, Démons furieux). Pollux fights the demons with the help of the god Mercury and descends into Hades.
The scene shows the Elysian fields in the Underworld. Castor sings the aria Séjours de l'éternelle paix: the beautiful surroundings cannot comfort him for the loss of Telaira, neither can a Chorus of Happy Spirits. He is amazed to see his brother Pollux, who tells him of his sacrifice. Castor says he will only take the opportunity to revisit the land of the living for one day so he can see Telaira for the last time.
Castor returns to Sparta. When Phoebe sees him, she thinks Pollux is dead for good and commits suicide so she can join him in the Underworld. But Castor tells Telaira he only plans to remain alive with her for a single day. Telaira bitterly accuses him of never having loved her. Jupiter descends in a storm as a deus ex machina to resolve the dilemma. He declares that Castor and Pollux can both share immortality. The opera ends with the fête de l'univers(""Festival of the Universe"") in which the stars, planets and sun celebrate the god's decision and the twin brothers are received into the Zodiac as the constellation of Gemini.

Hippolyte et Aricie,"Diana, chaste goddess of the moon and the hunt, and Cupid, god of love, argue over who will dominate. Their quarrel is settled by Jupiter, who decrees that love will rule over all hearts for one day every year. Diana vows to protect the mortals Hippolytus (Hippolyte) and Aricia (Aricie).
Hippolytus is in love with a young woman, Aricia, the daughter of Pallas, the enemy of his father Theseus (Thésée), King of Athens. Pallas compels Aricia to take a vow of chastity to Diana. Before she does so, Hippolytus reveals his love for Aricia and Diana promises to protect the couple. This enrages Phaedra (Phèdre), Queen of Athens, who harbours an illicit love for Hippolytus, her stepson. News arrives that her husband Theseus is dead. Phaedra may now pursue her passion for Hippolyte and offer him the crown of Athens.
Neptune, father of Theseus, has promised to answer his son’s prayers three times during his life. Theseus’s first prayer is to reach Hades safely, where he hopes to rescue his friend Pirithous. Theseus fights with the Fury Tisiphone, but successfully reaches Pluto’s court. Pluto condemns Theseus to share the fate of his friend Pirithous, but allows him a trial. When Theseus loses, he prays a second time to Neptune, and Pluto is powerless to hold him. As Theseus is leaving, however, the Furies (Les Parques) predict that though he may leave Hades, he will find Hell in his own home.

Phaedra tries to kill herself but Hippolytus prevents it. Theseus arrives unexpectedly. Unsure what to make of the scene, he accuses Hippolytus of trying to rape Phaedra. Phaedra rushes off and Hippolytus nobly refuses to denounce his stepmother. Theseus decides to use his last prayer to Neptune to punish Hippolytus.
Hippolytus and Aricia have escaped together to Diana’s realm. A monster suddenly emerges from the sea to punish Hippolytus. He tries to fight it and is defeated. Phaedra confesses her guilt for Hippolytus’s death.

Madama Butterfly,"Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton of the US Navy is preparing to go through a form of marriage with a Japanese girl, Cio-Cio-San (Madama Butterfly). He is being shown over their future house on a hill overlooking Nagasaki Harbor by the marriage broker Goro, who has provided the house as well as the bride. They are joined by the American consul, Sharpless, and Pinkerton explains that both wedding contract and house lease are for 99 years, terminable at any time at short notice.
Pinkerton finds this arrangment very convenient, as his philosophy is that while wandering the world as an American sailor he is free to take up with girls from any port, but he will eventually settle down and marry a proper, American wife.
Disturbed by this creed, Sharpless tries to warn Pinkerton against hurting Butterfly. He is even more shocked when she arrives, accompanied by friends and relations, and reveals that, her father being dead, poverty has forced her to become a geisha, and that she is only 15. Butterfly shows Pinkerton the few possessions she is bringing with her, but shrinks from explaining one of them. Goro whispers that it is the dagger her father killed himself with, at the emperor's order. She confesses that she has been to the mission, wishing to adopt her husband's religion.
The wedding is performed, but the celebrations are interrupted by the arrival of Butterfly's uncle, the Bonze (Buddhist priest), who denounces her for betraying the gods of her ancestors. Her family flees in horror. Butterfly is comforted by Pinkerton. Night falls and after an impassioned duet, they enter their new home. 
Three years later, Butterfly, with almost no money left, is waiting faithfully for Pinkerton's return in the company of her servant Suzuki. Sharpless arrives with a letter from Pinkerton asking him to break the news that he has married his American wife, and although his ship will soon be coming to Nagasaki, he does not intend to see Butterfly again.
Before Sharpless can begin she aks him when the robins nest in America. Her husband promised to return when the robins nested, but they have done so three times in Japan since he left, so she thinks that perhaps American robins have different habits.
At this Goro, eavesdropping, laughs and Butterfly complains that he is always hanging around, offering her new suitors. Even when one of these, the rich Prince Yamadori, arrives in person, she refuses to take him seriously. Goro explains to Sharpless that it would be better for her if she married again, but she still considers herself properly married to Pinkerton, according to American law. Sharpless tries to break the news about Pinkerton, but she keeps interrupting him with eager comments and questions and, beyond realising that Pinkerton is coming back to Japan, doesn't take in the sense of the letter. Sharpless gives up and asks her what she would do if Pinkerton were never to return and she answers that she would choose to die. He tries to persuade her to marry Yamadori. She becomes angry, then shows him the child she has born to Pinkerton. Sharpless leaves, promising to tell Pinkerton of the child's existence. Suzuki drags in Goro, who has been saying that no one knows who the baby's father is. Butterfly is furious and attacks him with the dagger, but Suzuki calms her and he scuttles off.
The gun of the port is heard, denoting the arrival of a ship. Looking through a telescope, Butterfly sees that it is Pinkerton's ship and makes joyful preparations to receive him. She and Suzuki decorate the house throughout with flowers, and, with the baby, prepare to wait through the night till he comes. 
Next morning at dawn, only Butterfly is still awake. Pinkerton has not come and she prepares to rest for a while. He arrives with Sharpless, but they warn Suzuki not to rouse Butterfly. Pinkerton is surprised that his arrival was expected and Sharpless reminds him that he had warned him three years ago that Butterfly was taking the ceremony seriously. Suzuki sees a strange woman in the garden. It is Pinkerton's wife, Kate. They tell Suzuki that she must find a way of breaking the news to Butterfly, adding that Kate is willing to take the baby back to America, as the best thing for him.
Pinkerton is overcome with remorse, but Sharpless tells him to leave, as it will be easier to break the news if he is not there. Butterfly runs eagerly out of the bedroom, expecting Pinkerton, but seeing only Kate. She forces the truth from the reluctant Suzuki. Broken-hearted, she realises that a further blow is in store, understanding that she is being asked to part with her child. For his good, she consents, but says that Pinkerton must come himself in half an hour to take him. Sharpless and Kate leave and Butterfly sends the reluctant Suzuki (who understands what she intends) to play with the child.
As Butterfly prepares to commit ritual suicide with her father's dagger, Suzuki pushes the child into the room, hoping to distract her, but she bids him a passionate farewell, blindfolds him and stabs herself, dying at Pinkerton's feet when he rushes in the door calling her name.

Manon Lescaut,"A group of students, drinking outside the inn, mingles with the townspeople. The student des Grieux joins his friends. In answer to some chaffing by Edmondo, one of the students, he assures them that he has never known the pangs of love. To humor them he accosts a group of girls, asking if one of them will prove to be the one to ignite the spark in him.
A coach arrives, depositing Manon, her brother Lescaut and Geronte, an elderly rich tax-collector. Des Grieux is struck by Manon's beauty, and seizes the opportunity to address her when she is alone. In answer to his eager questions she tells him she is being sent to a convent by her father. She agrees to meet him later. Des Grieuz rhapsodises about her and his fellow students are amused to find him so suddenly in love.
A brief conversation between Lescaut and Geronte shows them beginning to understand each other. Lescaut has an eye to the main chance and Geronte is obviously interested in Manon and invites Lescaut to supper. But then he waits until Lescaut's attention is turned elsewhere (he joins some students in a game of cards) and makes an arrangement with the innkeeper to have a coach ready in an hour's time. He intends to abduct Manon, but he is overheard by Edmondo who warns des Grieux and they plan to outwit Geronte.
When Manon reappears she tells des Grieux that all her joy in life is gone; but she begins to respond to his declaration of love. However when he warns her of Geronte's intentions and urges her to fly with him instead, she is most reluctant. Finally she yields and they escape, urged on by Edmondo, just as Geronte appears.
Edmondo tells him what has happened and he then tells Lescaut who, after a burst of rage, becomes philosophical, consoling Geronte with his account of Manon's character: she will not long be happy with a poor student and since he can see Geronte has such a ""fatherly"" interest in her he feels that the future happiness of Geronte with Manon is assured, with himself added to the menage as ""son.""
Manon is putting the finishing touches to a stylish toilette when her brother appears. He congratulates her (and himself, as architect of the scenario) on her present position. He had tracked her down and lured her away by dazzling her with Geronte's wealth. But Manon tells him she misses des Grieux and would now prefer love and poverty to her present loveless wealth. Lescaut tells her he has been helping des Grieux to make his fortune by teaching him to cheat at cards.
Some singers serenade Manon with a madrigal written by Geronte. When she complains of boredom Lescaut descides to go and find des Grieux and tell him where to find her.
Manon is instructed in courtly dancing, to the rapturous admiration of an audience of Geronte and his friends. She dances with Geronte and sings him a pastoral ditty, describing a shepherdess pining for her shepherd. The company leaves for an outing and Manon waits for her sedan chair.
Des Grieux enters and reproaches her for her faithlessness, to which she offers a variety of answers: she is sorry, she did it all for him, she loves him passionately. He is won over by her spell and reaffirms his love. In the middle of their ecstatic reunion Geronte comes back. Manon answers his reproaches with a mirror, asking him to compare himself with her and des Grieux. He departs, promising to return. As the lovers prepare to depart Manon expresses regret at leaving her life of luxury, but when des Grieux upbraids her and accuses her of bringing him to a life of shame she promises to be good.
Lescaut rushes in out of breath to tell them that Geronte has been to the police and that Manon will be punished with deportation. Manon delays their departure by trying to collect as many jewels as possible, and when the arresting party, headed by Geronte, confronts the lovers, the jewels fall from her cloak. As she is taken away Lescaut restrains des Grieux as he draws his sword, warning him that he must stay free to save Manon.
A square near the harbor of Le Havre before dawn
Manon is in a cell waiting to be deported to America. Des Grieux and Lescaut have made a plan to save her and although nervous of the outcome Manon is persuaded to try to escape. But there is a commotion and Lescaut rushes in to warn des Grieux that the plan has failed.
Manon, with the other girls being deported, is led out of the building and a sergeant calls the roll while the townspeople comment freely on the proceedings and the individual girls. Lescaut tells them a tall story about Manon having been torn away from the arms of her lover, rousing their sympathy.
Des Grieux stands with her for as long as possible. She tells him to leave her, forget her and return to his father. When they come to drag Manon away he resists at first, but then turns to the captain of the waiting ship and begs to be allowed to go with her, as cabin boy if necessary. The captain accepts him jovially - ""so you want to populate America, do you?"" and des Grieux joins the ship as cabin boy. 
Des Grieux tries to support and encourage Manon who is weak from thirst and exhaustion. She begs him to try and find water and when he has gone laments her sad fate. He returns unsuccessful and she dies in his arms. He flings himself on her body.

Tosca,"Angelotti, a political prisoner who has just escaped from the fortress of Castel Sant'Angelo, runs into the church, looks for a key and uses it to open a private chapel, where he hides. The Sacristan bustles about and the painter Mario Cavaradossi continues work on his picture of Mary Magdalene.
He has used as his model a fair-haired woman who has been frequenting the church. While admiring her fair beauty, he prefers the dark loveliness of his mistress, the celebrated singer Floria Tosca. When the Sacristan goes outside, Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognised by Cavaradossi as a fellow revolutionary. Tosca is heard calling to Cavaradossi and he advises Angelotti to hide again, giving him a basket of food he has brought for his own meal. Tosca, having heard his voice, is suspicious that he has been entertaining a woman. He soothes her and they look forward to being together in his villa after her concert that night. She is about to leave when she sees the painting. Her jealousy is aroused again, particularly when she recognises the model as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi assures Tosca that he does not know the lady, but has seen her in the church, and she leaves, warning him playfully henceforth to paint only dark-eyed women. Angelotti, emerging from the chapel, reveals that the Marchesa Attavanti is his sister, her presence in the church due to her part in his escape plan, as she has brought women's clothes for him and hidden them in the family chapel. Cavaradossi offers him refuge in his villa outside the city, but before he can leave, a cannon shot signals that the escape has been discovered, and Cavaradossi leaves with him.
The Sacristan, full of the news of the defeat of Napoleon, calls the choirboys to prepare to sing a celebratory Te Deum. Their riotous celebration is interrupted by the arrival of Scarpia, the chief of police, with some of his agents. A search verifies his suspicions that Angelotti had taken refuge in the church, one clue being a fan which Angelotti has dropped. Tosca, returning to tell her lover that she will be late that night because she has to sing in a victory cantata, is disconcerted to find him gone. Scarpia, who has had a lustful eye on her for some time and suspects Cavaradossi's part in the escape, plays on her jealousy in the hope that she will lead him to Angelotti. He shows her the fan, claiming that he found it near the painter's easel - a sign of an interrupted assignation.
Recognising the Attavanti crest, she is only too easily persuaded that Cavaradossi has been unfaithful and sets off for the villa to confront the supposed lovers. Sending his agents after her, Scarpia congratulates himself on the success of his plans, then joins in the Te Deum.
That night Scarpia eats his supper as he waits for his agents to bring in Angelotti. He sends a note inviting Tosca to visit him after the victory cantata. He is furious when his agent Spoletta confesses that they had found no trace of Angelotti, but mollified when he learns that they have arrested Cavaradossi because of his suspicious behavior. Cavaradossi defies Scarpia and denies knowing anything about Angelotti, so Scarpia orders his interrogation - using any means necessary. He is unsuccessful in his attempt to trick Tosca into revealing Angelotti's whereabouts, but she is unable to resist Cavaradossi's cries of pain as he is tortured, and gives the information.
Cavaradossi reproaches her bitterly. When news is brought that Napoleon had after all been victorious at Marengo, he exultantly taunts Scarpia, who orders his immediate execution. At first Scarpia turns a deaf ear to Tosca's pleas for mercy, but then reveals that the price for Cavaradossi's life is Tosca herself. In despair, she sees no way out, despite her revulsion, which only makes her more desirable in Scarpia's eyes.
In her presence he gives the orders for a fake execution, expressing himself in such a way that it is clear to Spoletta, but not to Tosca, that the execution is in fact to be real. She demands a safe-conduct for herself and Cavaradossi, so that they can leave Rome for ever. As he writes it, she notices a knife on the table, and as Scarpia prepares to embrace her, she stabs him. 
A shepherd sings in the distance and church bells ring as preparations are made for the execution. Cavaradossi tries to write a last letter to Tosca, but is overcome by memories of their happiness.
Tosca runs in with the safe-conduct and tells him that she has killed Scarpia. Telling him about the mock execution, she instructs him how to fall and wait till the soldiers have gone, but when she calls him, Cavaradossi does not move and she discovers that he is dead. Angry cries indicate that Scarpia's death has been discovered and Spoletta leads the soldiers in pursuit of Tosca, but she leaps from the battlements.

Turandot,"A mandarin reads a proclamation that the Princess Turandot will marry any man of royal rank who successfully answers three riddles propounded by her, but if he fails he must lose his head. The Prince of Persia, having just failed, will be beheaded at moonrise. The crowd is eager for the execution and nearly tramples underfoot the old blind Timur, deposed Tartar king, who is led by the slave girl Li, who cries to the crowd to take pity on him. Calaf, son of Timur, who had been separated from him in exile, recognises his father. Their joy at finding one another still alive is overshadowed by the continued persecution of the king who had defeated them, who is still pursuing Calaf. Li explains that she has guided Timur since his kingdom was lost, because once Calaf had smiled at her.
Although the people have been longing for the moon to rise and the execution to take place, when they see the young prince led to his death, their mood changes and they call for mercy. But Turandot appears on a balcony and signs for the execution to proceed. Calaf is struck by her beauty and, ignoring the warning of his father and Li, the arguments of the three courtiers Ping, Pang and Pong, and not even swayed by the dying cry of the Prince of Persia, strikes the gong as a signal of his challenge for the hand of the princess. 
Ping, Pang and Pong remember wistfully the peaceful retreats they have left to become courtiers under the cruel regime of Turandot. They express the hope that she will eventually yield to love and bring to an end the parade of executions, but they are brought back to the immediate prospect of another potential victim as the crowd gathers.
The people hail the appearance of the emperor, who, weary of so much bloodshed, tries to dissuade Calaf from attempting the contest. But Calaf respectfully insists.
Turandot appears and, having explained that her aversion to men is based on the fate of a princess of her race who was violated and murdered by an invader, asks the riddles. Calaf successfully answers: Hope, Blood and Turandot. Turandot begs her father not to force her to marry the stranger, but he answers that he is bound by an oath. She tells Calaf that she will never be his, and he, touched by her distress, agrees to set her one riddle in his turn: if by dawn she can learn his name, he will die; if not, she must marry him. She consents, and the emperor hopes that at dawn Calaf will be his son-in-law. 
Heralds proclaim that no one in the city shall sleep till the mystery of the unknown prince is solved. Calaf repeats their words, confident that by dawn he will have conquered and Turandot will be his. He is approached by Ping, Pang and Pong, offering beautiful girls, riches and glory if he will go away and leave them in peace. The people are angry with him because they are suffering on his account. Guards drag in Timur and Li, who have been seen with Calaf and are assumed to know his name. To save Timur, Li declares that she alone knows the secret and will not reveal it.
Turandot appears as the guards begin to torture Li and is unable to understand what gives her the strength to endure. Li answers that it is the power of love, which Turandot will soon feel herself. Seizing a knife from a guard, Li kills herself. Timur and the people, fearing that her offended spirit will seek revenge, pray to her ghost not to harm them, and even Ping, Pang and Pong feel something stirring in their long atrophied hearts.
The body of Li is carried out and Calaf and Turandot are left alone. He removes her veil and kisses her. With the first tears she has ever shed she confesses that she has feared and loved him since first seeing him. In response to her admission of defeat, he tells her his name.
Turandot triumphantly announces to the emperor and assembled people that she knows the stranger's name: it is Love. Calaf and Turandot embrace and the emperor and people rejoice.
